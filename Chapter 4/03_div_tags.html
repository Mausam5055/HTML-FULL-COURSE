<!-- -------DIV TAGS-----

Imagine you're organizing your room, and you have different boxes to keep your toys, books, and clothes. Each box helps 
keep things neat and in their place. In HTML, the <div> tag 
is like one of those boxes.

A <div> tag is used to group other HTML elements together. 
You can put things like text, images, or buttons inside it, 
just like youâ€™d put different items in your boxes. By 
using <div>, it's easier to style or organize parts of your webpage.
    
So, think of a <div> like a container that holds other things and helps keep your webpage nice and organized!
