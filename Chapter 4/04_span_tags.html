<!-- ---------SPAN TAG -------


Span is also a container used for other HTML elements
Inline Element (takes width as per size
A <span> tag in HTML is like a little box you can use to group parts of a text or a webpage. Imagine you have a sentence, and you want to color just one word red. You can wrap that word with a <span> tag, like wrapping a toy in a special paper to make it stand out. This tag helps you style or mark parts of the page without changing the layout. It’s like using a highlighter for specific words or sections! -->

  <!-- ----- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPAN AND DIV TAG -------- -->

<!-- The difference between <div> and <span> tags in HTML is like the difference between a big box and a small label.

 1.<div> tag: Think of it as a big box. You can put lots of things inside, like paragraphs, images, or other parts of a webpage. It usually breaks up the content into sections, like a block. Imagine stacking up shoe boxes—each one is its own separate block, so things are organized neatly.
        
 2.<span> tag: This is like a small label or sticker that you can put on just a word or small piece of content. It doesn’t create a big block or break things up. It’s used for smaller pieces of text or items that you want to style without affecting the whole layout.
        
        So, if you're organizing big sections, you use a <div>. If you're marking or highlighting a small part, you use a <span>     -->
