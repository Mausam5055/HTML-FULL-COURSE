             <!-- -------FORM IN HTML------------

Forms are used to collect data from the user
Eg- sign up/login/help requests/contact me
<form>
    form content
</form> -->


      <!-- --------ACTION IN FORM--------

In an HTML form, the action is like giving directions to the form. It tells the browser where to send the information that you type into the form.

Imagine you're filling out a paper form at school, and once you're done, you hand it to your teacher. In HTML, the action is the teacher (or whoever gets your form). It’s a URL (like a web address) that points to where the form data will be sent when you press the "submit" button.       -->

    <!-- -------INPUT IN HTML------------

    The <input> element in an HTML form is like a blank space where you can enter different kinds of information. It's the part of the form where people can type things in, like their name, a password, or even pick a date. Think of it like a box you fill in on a paper form, but on a website.

Here’s what different types of <input> elements do:

1.Text box: A place to type regular words, like your name or email.
<input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name">

2.Password box: A place to type a password, where the characters turn into dots or stars for privacy.
<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter your password">

3.Submit button: A button that you click to send all the information you typed in the form.
<input type="submit" value="Submit">

4.Checkbox: A small box you can click to select something (like "yes" or "I agree").
<input type="checkbox" name="agree"> I agree

There are many other types of <input> fields, but these are the basics. They help collect the information and then send it when you’re done. -->
