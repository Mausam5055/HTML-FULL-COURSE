        <!-- -------LABELS IN HTML------------

In HTML, a <label> is like a name tag for something you're supposed to fill in or click on in a form. It tells you what the nearby box or button is for, making it easier to understand what you're supposed to do.

For example, if there's a box to type your name, the label says "Name," so you know that’s where your name goes.
            
            Here’s what it looks like:
            
        
            <label for="username">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username">

In this example:
1."Name:" is the label, telling you to type your name.
2.The for="username" part connects the label to the input box (the text field) where you type your name. -->
