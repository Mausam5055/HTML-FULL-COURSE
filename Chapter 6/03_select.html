     <!-- -----------SELECT--------
In HTML, a select element is like a drop-down menu where you can pick an option from a list. Itâ€™s similar to how, in some video games or apps, you might have to choose your favorite character or select a difficulty level from a list.

When you click on the menu, it opens up and shows different choices, and you can click on the one you want. After you pick, it shows your choice.      -->
