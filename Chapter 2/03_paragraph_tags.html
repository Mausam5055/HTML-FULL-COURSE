 <!-- ---------TOGGLE WORD WRAP------

 In VS Code (Visual Studio Code), "toggle word wrap" is a feature 
 that changes how text is displayed in your code editor.

What is Word Wrap?
When word wrap is on, long lines of code or text that don't fit in 
the window will automatically wrap onto the next line, making everything 
visible without needing to scroll horizontally. When 
word wrap is off, those long lines will just keep going on one 
line, and you'll need to scroll to see the rest.

How to Toggle Word Wrap:
1.Use the Menu:
        a.Click on View in the top menu.
        b.Select Toggle Word Wrap from the dropdown.

2.Use a Shortcut:
        a.On Windows: Press Alt + Z.
        b.On macOS: Press Option + Z.

This is a quick way to switch between wrapping the lines or keeping them long, 
depending on your preference for readability. -->
