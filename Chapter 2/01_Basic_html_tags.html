<!-- ------HTML ATTRIBUTES-----

Attributes are used to add more information to the tag
            <html lang="en">
here, "lang="en""  is an Attribute 
we can also write the attribute inside single quoted bracket as 
"lang='en'"

  --------EXPLAINATON-------
The html tag with lang="en" is telling the web browser 
(like Chrome or Safari) that the content of the webpage is 
written in English.magine you're writing a book for someone 
who speaks English. You put a note at the beginning saying, 
"Hey, this whole book is in English!" so they know how to read
it. In the same way, the web browser sees this tag and knows 
it should expect English when displaying the page.
The html tag also marks the start of the page's code, 
telling the browser, "This is where the webpage begins!" -->
