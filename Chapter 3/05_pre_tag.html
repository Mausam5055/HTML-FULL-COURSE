<!-- ------PRE Tag------

 Imagine you're writing a story, and you want to make sure that
  everything you write—spaces, lines, and even the exact way it 
  looks—stays exactly the same when someone reads it. Normally, 
 when you write on a website, the browser might squish everything
  together or remove extra spaces.

But when you use the <pre> tag in HTML, it’s like putting your
text inside a special box where nothing changes. The browser
shows it just the way you type it—spaces, lines, and all. 
It's perfect for showing poems, code, or anything that needs to 
look a certain way.

 EG. <pre>
    This is a poem!
    
    Line one.
          Line two with spaces.
  Line three!
  </pre>

  
  When you see this in a browser, it will look exactly the way you typed it. Cool, right?   -->
