When you press Shift + ! on your keyboard, you get an exclamation
 mark (!). In HTML, the exclamation mark is special because it 
 helps with two important things when you're making a webpage.

1. Starting the Webpage (DOCTYPE)
At the very beginning of your webpage, you tell the browser 
(like Chrome or Firefox) what type of page it is by using this 
code: <!DOCTYPE html>

This says, "Hey, browser! This is an HTML5 page!" 
The exclamation mark helps the browser understand that message.
Without it, the browser might get confused!

2. Leaving Secret Notes (Comments)
Sometimes, you might want to leave a note for yourself or 
someone else in your code that won’t show up on the webpage. 
To do this, you use something called a comment. It looks like 
this:  <!-- This is a comment -->
  
The exclamation mark (!) is part of the comment, and it tells 
the browser, "Don’t show this on the webpage, it's just a 
note!" It's like leaving a sticky note that only you or other 
coders can see, but not the people visiting the website.

EXAMPLE:
    <!DOCTYPE html>  <!-- This tells the browser we are using HTML5 -->
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
        <!-- This is a hidden note in the code! -->
    </body>
    </html>

1.The first <!DOCTYPE html> starts your page.
2.The comment <!-- This is a hidden note --> won’t be visible on
 the webpage, just in the code!

 In short, when you press Shift + ! in HTML, it helps make your 
 webpage work correctly and lets you leave secret notes in the code!
