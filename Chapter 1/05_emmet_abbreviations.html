<!-- Emmet is like a magic shortcut for writing code in HTML. 
Imagine you want to build a web page, but instead of typing 
every single thing, you can use Emmet to type a small code and 
it will grow into a bigger one!

How Does It Work?
Think of Emmet as a tool that helps you write code faster. 
You type a short version of the code, and it instantly turns 
into the full version.

Example:
    1.If you want to make an HTML element like this:
    "<p>Hello, world!</p>"
    You can just type:p, And
    Then press Tab, and Emmet will complete it to:<p></p>
    Now, you can fill it with your text: Hello, world! between
    <p></p> as "<p>Hello, world!</p>"


In Short:
Emmet is like a shortcut or a magic trick that helps you 
write HTML code much faster by turning small words into full 
code. Itâ€™s a super helpful tool when you're learning how to 
build websites! -->
