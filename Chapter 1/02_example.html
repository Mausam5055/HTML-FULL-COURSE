<!-- EXAMPLE:
Let’s say you’re making a webpage about your favorite animal:
        "<h1>My Favorite Animal: Cats</h1>
        <p>Cats are small, fluffy, and love to sleep all day!</p>
        <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute sleeping cat">
        <a href="https://cats.com">Learn more about cats</a>"

here,
1.The title is inside <h1> tags, so it looks big.
2.The sentence about cats is inside <p> tags, so it looks like 
normal text.
3.The picture of the cat is shown with an <img> tag.
4.And there's a link with the <a> tag that takes you to another 
website to learn more about cats.

SUMMARY:
HTML tags are like little helpers that tell the computer how to 
show things on a webpage. Just remember that they usually come 
in pairs (an opening and closing tag), like sandwich bread with 
your content in the middle. Cool, right? -->
