             <!-- --- HTML TAGS-----

Imagine you're writing a letter, but instead of using paper, 
you're making a webpage. To tell the computer how you want 
things to look or work on your page, you use HTML tags. 
These are like special instructions that the computer 
understands.

Q: What are HTML tags?
Think of HTML tags like labels or markers. They help the 
computer know what kind of information you're putting on the 
page, like whether it's a heading, a picture, or a link to 
another website.

Here’s how they work:
Tags are like sandwich bread: You start with an opening tag, 
then put the content in the middle, and finish with a closing 
tag. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag but with a 
/ in front.

For example, if you want to write a paragraph (some text), 
you use the paragraph tag:

            "<p>This is a sentence.</p>"

here,
a.<p> is the opening tag.
b.</p> is the closing tag.
c.In between, you write your sentence.

Let's break down some common tags:


1.Headings: If you want a big title on your page, you use the 
heading tag.
            "<h1>This is a big title!</h1>"
here,
a.<h1> makes the text look big, like a title!
b.There are smaller headings too, like <h2>, <h3>, and so on

2.Paragraph: This is for writing normal sentences or paragraphs,
 like in a story or article.    
       "<p>This is a paragraph with regular text.</p>" 

3.Images: If you want to show a picture, you use the image tag. 
It looks a little different because it doesn’t need a closing 
tag:  
         <img src="puppy.jpg" alt="A cute puppy">
here,
a.src is the picture’s location (where the picture is saved).
b.alt describes the picture (so people know what it is, even if 
it doesn't load).

4.Links: Want to make a button or word that takes people to 
another webpage? You use the link tag.
"<a href="https://example.com">Click here to visit a cool 
    website!</a>"

here,
a.<a> stands for anchor, which means a link.
b.href is the address you want to link to.    -->
