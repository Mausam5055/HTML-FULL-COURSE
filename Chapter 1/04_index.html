          <!-- ----------What is index.html?-----------

Imagine your website is like a book, and each webpage is 
like a different page in the book. index.html is the 
first page of the book—the one everyone reads first when 
they open it. It's like the homepage of your website.

EXAMPLE:
When you go to a website, like www.coolgames.com, the 
computer looks for a special file called index.html to 
know what to show you. This file tells the computer what 
the main page should look like, what text to show, what 
pictures to display, and where the buttons should go

Why Do We Use index.html?
1.It’s the Starting Page: When someone types your website’s
name, like www.myawesomewebsite.com, the computer knows to
show the index.html file because it’s the first page of 
your site.

2. Makes it Easy to Find: If your website didn’t have an 
index.html file, the computer wouldn’t know which page to 
show first, so it’s like having a front cover for your 
website’s "book."

Example:
Let’s say you have a website about your favorite hobby, 
drawing. The first thing people see is your homepage, and 
that’s what you put in the index.html file:

        "<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>Welcome to My Drawing Site!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hi! I Love Drawing!</h1>
            <p>Check out my cool drawings below!</p>
        </body>
        </html>"

here,
    1.<h1> is like the big title on your webpage, just 
        like the title of a book.
    2.<p> is a paragraph where you explain what your 
        website is about.
    In Short:
    1.index.html is the main or first page of your website.
    2.When you type a website's address (like www.coolgames.com), the computer automatically shows you the content from the index.html file because it knows this is the "home" page.         -->
