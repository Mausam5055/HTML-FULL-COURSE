         <!-- --------LIVE SERVER-------

The Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code is a popular tool used
by web developers to create a local development server. It allows you 
to view your web pages in real time and automatically reloads the 
browser whenever you make changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript 
files. This feature makes the web development process smoother and more 
efficient by reducing the need to manually refresh the browser after 
every update.

            Key Features of Live Server Extension:

1.Real-Time Reloading: When you save changes in your HTML, CSS, or 
JavaScript files, the Live Server automatically reloads the browser 
to reflect the updates. This allows for an instant preview of changes 
without needing to refresh the page manually.

2.Local Development Server: Live Server creates a local development 
environment by running your web project on a local server 
(typically at http://127.0.0.1:5500 or similar). This simulates 
how your project will behave on the web, as some features 
(like AJAX requests or dynamic content) require a server environment.

3.Easy Setup: After installing the extension, you can start Live Server
with a single click or command. You don’t need to set up or configure 
anything extra. The extension handles running the server and 
automatically opens your default browser.

4.Support for Dynamic Content: Since the server behaves like a real web 
server, it allows you to work with dynamic content or simulate a 
production environment when developing complex web applications.

7.Customization: Live Server has configuration options, so you can 
change the default port, enable or disable browser auto-refresh, and 
more, according to your needs. -->



<!--         Summary:
The Live Server extension makes web development faster 
and more efficient by providing a local server and 
real-time updates. It’s ideal for developers working with 
static websites, single-page applications (SPAs), or any 
other web projects that need frequent changes and testing. -->
