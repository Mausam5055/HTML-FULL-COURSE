HTML Tag:
A container for some content or other HTML tags

<p> This is a paragraph</p>

here in above:
1. "This is a paragraph" is the content of html
2. "<p> This is a paragraph</p>" is called the element of html
3. "<p>" is called a opening tag
4. "</p>" i called a closing tag

like this way we can put all the thingd inside a "tag"(container)
that we want to see in our website

NOTES:
1.Most of html elements have opening & closing tags
with content in between,as in above we have a closing And
a opening tag for the line "This is a paragraph"

2.Some tags have no content in between, eg - <br>

3.We can use inspect element/view page source to edit html 
in chrome webage
